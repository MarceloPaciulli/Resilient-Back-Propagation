# Resilient-Back-Propagation
The most common technique used to train Neural Networks is the back-propagation (BP) algorithm. It requires a value for a parameter called "Learning Rate". The effectiveness of BP is highly sensitive to the value of LR. Rprop (Resilient BP) was developed by researchers in 1993 in an attempt to improve upon the back-propagation algorithm.
